                        <p class="Cloud_Nine">Cloud nine was a project aimed at creating flying vehicles with the use of electromagnets.
                            This would be made possible with the principle of magnetic effect on electric current <br>
                            with the earth providing the influential magnetic field which would push the "Magni-plane"<br>
                            into the air. Sounds great right!

                        <p id="Alchemy_Intro">Alchemy is the art of transformation.</p>
                        <p>That basically sums up what this project is about. <br>
                        For 2 millenia alchemists have tried to make the Pjilosophers stone that would llow them to turn
                        any piece of metal into gold but what if we didn't need a phiosophers stone.
                        Years of chemistry and rdioactivity have shown us that we are able to create new elements through fission
                        and fusion. <br>
                        Though this may seem expensive and inefficient I have a plan on how to make the most out of these two processes.</p>
